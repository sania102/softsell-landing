  1. Upload License  
  2. Get Valuation  
  3. Get Paid

- **Why Choose Us**  
  Highlights key benefits using bullet points with icons and short descriptions.

- **Customer Testimonials**  
  Two dummy reviews with names, roles, and companies to build trust.

  The site is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React.js with Vite for fast development and build.
- Deployment on Vercel for quick and reliable hosting.

---

## Design Choices

- Used a clean and modern layout with coherent color palette and typography.
- Focused on simplicity and clarity for easy user navigation.
- Responsive layout ensures usability on all device types.

---

## Challenges & Notes

- Attempted to integrate **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling and utility-first CSS benefits.  
- However, faced issues with Tailwind CSS setup in the Vite environment due to recent package changes (Tailwind's PostCSS plugin migration).  
- After multiple attempts, could not resolve the Tailwind integration error (`tailwindcss` plugin issue and PostCSS config loading errors).  
- Decided to proceed with manually written CSS for full control and guaranteed styling reliability.

## Deployment

- Hosted live on Vercel: [softsell-landing-livid.vercel.app]
- Source code available on GitHub: [https://github.com/sania102/softsell-landing](https://github.com/sania102/softsell-landing)

## Time Spent

Approximately 3-4 hours were invested in design, development, troubleshooting, and deployment.

---

## Future Improvements (If time permitted)

- Successfully integrate Tailwind CSS or use another utility-first CSS framework.
- Add light/dark mode toggle for better user experience.
- Implement smooth animations using libraries like Framer Motion.
- Add an AI-powered customer chat widget using OpenAI API or Langchain for real-time help.
- Improve form validation and possibly add backend integration for lead capture.
